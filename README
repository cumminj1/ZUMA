Z-Ursae Majoris is a late-type, semi-regular red giant star (SRb). Magnitude typically varies by 2 magnitudes
Amateur observations, primarily from AAVSO will becleaned up and compared to limited CCD data to determine
its reliability, such that the nature of the aperiodicity can be determined (overtones of the fundamental frequency?).
Given the shape of this data, a simple DFT or FFT is unlikely to work, and as such it is planned that the data will
be binned and analysed using PDM, or "phase dispersion minimisation" using a python code
adapted from the original method of Stellingwerf.

It may be possible to obtain spectrographic data of the star, however it is currently unclear as to whether this 
data will be useful.

It may also be worth comparing this star to other stars with similar classifications such as MIRA or RV Tauri stars.
